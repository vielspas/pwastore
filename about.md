# Welcome to free collection of Progressive Web Applications

PWA Store is a community driven collection of [progressive web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application).

The site is hosted using Github-pages which means that anyone can contribute to the list of PWAs simply by submiting a pull reguest to the [repository](https://github.com/vielspas/pwastore).

We believe PWA is the correct way to run and distribute applications, unlike closed appstores owned by tech companies. This is how things should have been in the first place!
